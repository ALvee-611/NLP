# Analyzing Customer Feedback

The goal of this project is to analyze customer feedback from different channels such as social media, customer service calls and customer reviews. We will use it to determine if the overall sentiment is positve or not and hence provide valuable insight by identifying issues and areas of improvements as well as monitor customer satisfaction over time.
